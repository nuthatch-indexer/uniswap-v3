# uniswap-v3

A [nuthatch](https://github.com/nuthatch-indexer/nuthatch) nest that indexes **Uniswap V3** — every
pool, discovered automatically from the factory, and its swaps, mints, and burns — into a local SQL
database. One binary, one config file, no graph-node, no gateway, no query fees.

Configured for **Arbitrum One** here, but Uniswap V3 uses the *same factory address on every chain*
(`0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984`), so re-pointing it at Ethereum, Optimism, Base, or
Polygon is a two-line edit (`chain` / `chain_id`).

## The one interesting line

Uniswap doesn't have a fixed set of contracts — it has a **factory** that spawns a new pool contract
for every token pair + fee tier, thousands of them. nuthatch handles that with a single rule:

```toml
[[factories]]
watch = "factory"        # the factory contract
event = "PoolCreated"    # …emits this when a pool is born
child_param = "pool"     # …carrying the new pool's address
template = "pool"        # …which we index under the shared `pool` ABI
```

That's the whole "dynamic data sources" story. Every pool that has ever existed or ever will is
discovered at runtime and indexed under shared tables (`pool__swap`, `pool__mint`, …), distinguished
by the implicit `address` column. No per-pool configuration.

## What you get

Raw event tables (`factory__pool_created`, `pool__swap`, `pool__mint`, `pool__burn`, …) plus authored
SQL **views** — the intended query surface:

| view | what it is |
|------|------------|
| `pools` | the pool registry: token pair, fee tier, tick spacing, creation block |
| `swaps` | every swap, joined to its pair, with the price derived from `sqrtPriceX96` |
| `pool_stats` | per-pool swap/mint/burn counts + latest price |
| `pool_volume` | per-pool gross volume (`sum(abs(amount))`) — the subgraph's `volumeToken0/1` |
| `tokens` | every token, ranked by how many pools reference it |
| `global` | one-row network summary |

```sh
nuthatch sql --dir . "SELECT * FROM global"
nuthatch sql --dir . "SELECT pool, swaps, volume_token0, volume_token1 FROM pool_volume ORDER BY swaps DESC LIMIT 10"
```

## Run it

```sh
nuthatch init --from https://github.com/nuthatch-indexer/uniswap-v3   # clone this nest
# point rpc_urls at your endpoint (a free Alchemy/Infura/dRPC key works great)
nuthatch dev --dir . --backfill 10000000 --seal-direct --window 5000   # a recent slice
nuthatch sql --dir .                                                    # query away
```

A **recent slice** (`--backfill N`) indexes pools created in that window and their activity — fast and
free-RPC-friendly. A full-history, every-pool-since-launch backfill is a bigger job (a paid RPC tier or
your own node); the workflow is identical.

## Honest edges

- **Token decimals / USD pricing** aren't here. Symbol and decimals require a contract call, which the
  declarative core deliberately doesn't do — so amounts and prices are in *raw* units. Join a vendored
  token-decimals list to get human values and USD.
- Amounts are the exact on-chain **int256** values (signed: one leg in, one out); `pool_volume` sums
  their absolute value. The `*_dec` columns are `DECIMAL(38,0)`, so arithmetic is exact, not floating.
